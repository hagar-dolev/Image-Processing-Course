Q2: suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that
could be used for super-resolution. A full answer consists of a description of the corruption function,
and how to properly use the restore_image() function for this task. For this context only, you could
optionally add additional operations before calling to restore_image().

The workflow is as below, similar to pyramid re-construction:

1) Corruption function:= Our noise will be zero padding and our blur will be (1/2, 1, 1/2)
2) We will train the network on sets of (small, large) images such that:
    on smaller versions of an image we implement the corruption function to the point it is in the size of the large image.
    Than we train the network to deblur, denoise the now larger small image so it will be closest to the original large.
3) Now, to restore an image, If we mean by that to enlarge it, we will first apply our corruption function
    and then will use predict on the model that we built.

In that way, we enlarge an image using the models we already built.
