Q1: Describe the effect of increasing the residual blocks on its performance for each task, both quantitatively
in terms of the plot you got and qualitatively in terms of the differences in the image outputs of
each model.

The effect is that the error is much smaller the more residual blocks there is.
We can see at the last epoch, the green line is no where near the yellow one, and the red is in the middle.
Of course it has an affect on the images, it is more accurate to predict an image when training with more residual
blocks, but, as we learned in class, it might "over" learn the kind of corruption or images we are using.
