Q2:  What happens if the center of the gaussian (in the space domain) will not be at the
(0,0) of the image?  Why does it happen?

The image will not be blurred correctly and it will result in the image breaking down to quarters in cyclic way on the image matrix.
This happens since we use the DFT as sort of LUT for the basis of the cos and sin waves, since the gaussian will not be
in coordinate with the DFT if it is in the center of the image, it results in a "bad" LUT.
