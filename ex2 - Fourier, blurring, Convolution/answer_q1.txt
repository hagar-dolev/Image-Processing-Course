Q1: Why did you get two different magnitude images?

More Noise
Because Fourier's derivatives are accurate by up to a scalar, so that scalar is the difference, and also, in Fourier's
derivatives there is an enhancement of the strong waves and decrease in the weak ones, as described in class:
Lecture 3 , page 33 in the presentation
So we can see more noise.
