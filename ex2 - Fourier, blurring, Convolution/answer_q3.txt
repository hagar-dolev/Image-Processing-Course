Q3:  What is the difference between the two results (Blurring in image space and blurring
in Fourier space)?


Although the difference is very small we can see it.
The difference is similar to the difference in the derivatives and it is the contrast, it seems that the dark colors
have gotten darker while the bright colors have gotten brighter, yet it is still blurred.
