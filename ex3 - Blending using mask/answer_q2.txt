What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
Q2: Blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...).

It is the "radius" of the pixels we take into account in blending, around each pixel, therefore, the larger it is,
the more visible the blending is.
This happens since it is enlarging the size of the kernel.
