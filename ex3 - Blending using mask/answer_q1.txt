What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?

It is the weight we want to give for each part of the pyramid, we can control how much of a current level of a pyramid
is counted in, for example, we can blend in the lowest level with something else and as we move on the pyramid
to let it be less significant, so our result will be mended, and the blending will not be full.
