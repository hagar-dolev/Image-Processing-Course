What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
Q3: Blending is performed with a varying number of pyramid levels (max_levels = 1,2,3,4,5,...).

When I blended with large number of pyramids it was as if the images were merged completely - both in color and light,
So it was almost un-noticeable, but when I brought back to the lower amount of pyramids the image blending has became more subtle,
and it was easier to see which part is which image.

I think this happens because the more pyramid levels we use, then the blending starts at a much lower resolution, so each
dominant pixel has a lot more wight compared to a dominant pixel in a larger image, which is less significant.
This will cause the image with more pixels to affect the image with less pixels in the blending area.
The weight of each pixel is more significant, and therefore the blending is "stronger".
